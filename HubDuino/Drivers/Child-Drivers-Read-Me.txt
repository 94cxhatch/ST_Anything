Please make a copy of all of the child-*.groovy device drivers from 

https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/devicetypes/ogiewon

and load them into you Hubitat Hub's "Drivers Code" section via the web interface.

These are the exact same Child Drivers (aka Device Handlers) used in SmartThings.
